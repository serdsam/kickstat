    "# Python Query Engine for Football Match Knowledge Graph\n",
    "# This documentation outlines the development and usage of a Python query engine for a knowledge graph of football matches. The knowledge graph is structured according to a schema that includes entities such as teams, players, matches, and events, and their interrelationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Schema Definition\n",
    "# The knowledge graph schema includes tables for nodes and relationships. Nodes represent entities such as Team, Player, Match, and Event. Relationships connect nodes, representing how they are related, such as a player participating in a match or an event occurring during a match.\n",
    "# The define_schema function initializes the database with this schema, creating node tables with their respective properties and primary keys, as well as relationship tables defining how nodes are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query Execution\n",
    "# find_matches_for_team\n",
    "# This function retrieves matches for a specific team, filtered by location preference (home, away, or both). It constructs a Cypher query that matches the Team node with the given team_name and finds related Match nodes based on the location_preference.\n",
    "# find_events_for_player_in_season\n",
    "# This function fetches all events a player was involved in during a specific season. It constructs a Cypher query that finds the Player node, the Event nodes related to that player, and filters by the Match nodes belonging to the specified season.\n",
    "# compare_players_based_on_events\n",
    "# This function compares players based on the count of a specific type of event they were involved in. It constructs a Cypher query that matches the Player node and counts the Event nodes of a given event_type, sorting the results to provide a comparison.\n",
    "# find_rare_events_for_player\n",
    "# This function is used to query rare events for a player and is designed to \"hop\" through the graph to retrieve related matches and competitions. It demonstrates how to extend a Cypher query to traverse multiple relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage Example\n",
    "# The script is executed in a command-line environment. After defining the schema and loading data once, the user can perform various queries based on the input provided.\n",
    "# Example user input structure:\n",
    "# user_input = {\n",
    "#  'team_name': 'Arsenal',\n",
    "#  'location_preference': 'home',\n",
    "#  'player_name': 'M. Salah',\n",
    "#  'season': '2022-2023',\n",
    "#  'event_type': 'Goal'\n",
    "# }The results from each query function are printed to the console, but in a production environment, they would typically be returned to a frontend application or further processed.\n",
