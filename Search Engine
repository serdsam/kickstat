# Documentation:


# Python Query Engine for Football Match Knowledge Graph
# This documentation outlines the development and usage of a Python query engine for a knowledge graph of football matches. The knowledge graph is structured according to a schema that includes entities such as teams, players, matches, and events, and their interrelationships.

# Schema Definition
# The knowledge graph schema includes tables for nodes and relationships. Nodes represent entities such as Team, Player, Match, and Event. Relationships connect nodes, representing how they are related, such as a player participating in a match or an event occurring during a match.
# The define_schema function initializes the database with this schema, creating node tables with their respective properties and primary keys, as well as relationship tables defining how nodes are connected.

# Query Execution
# find_matches_for_team
# This function retrieves matches for a specific team, filtered by location preference (home, away, or both). It constructs a Cypher query that matches the Team node with the given team_name and finds related Match nodes based on the location_preference.
# find_events_for_player_in_season
# This function fetches all events a player was involved in during a specific season. It constructs a Cypher query that finds the Player node, the Event nodes related to that player, and filters by the Match nodes belonging to the specified season.
# compare_players_based_on_events
# This function compares players based on the count of a specific type of event they were involved in. It constructs a Cypher query that matches the Player node and counts the Event nodes of a given event_type, sorting the results to provide a comparison.
# find_rare_events_for_player
# This function is used to query rare events for a player and is designed to "hop" through the graph to retrieve related matches and competitions. It demonstrates how to extend a Cypher query to traverse multiple relationships.


# Usage Example
# The script is executed in a command-line environment. After defining the schema and loading data once, the user can perform various queries based on the input provided.
# Example user input structure:
# user_input = {
#  'team_name': 'Arsenal',
#  'location_preference': 'home',
#  'player_name': 'M. Salah',
#  'season': '2022-2023',
#  'event_type': 'Goal'
# }The results from each query function are printed to the console, but in a production environment, they would typically be returned to a frontend application or further processed.
